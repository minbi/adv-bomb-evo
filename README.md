Advanced Bomb Evolution

The vision is to create a game where Runners will move across the screen as the player attempts to destroy them with Bombs.

## Bombs
Bombs are placed with the player touching the screen and will explode with varying delays and explosion patterns.

### Simple explosions
```
    |
 --[ ]--
    |
```
or
```
  \   /
   [ ]
  /   \
```
### Complex explosions
These may have trajectories created with sin or cosine functions.
(Too difficult for ASCII art.)

### Evolution
Bombs have the ability to evolve the way that they should explode.
The idea is to have a genetic algorithm to mix and match certain attributes (genes) that bombs could have.
These genes can also mutate i.e. The functions used to determine explosion pattern could be mutated. x^2+1 could become x^0.5+1
Bombs will evolve as the player uses them throughout the game to keep game play interesting.

## Runners
Runners will be generated by the game. Their paths may be straight lines or be defined by functions.
In a similar way as the Bombs, the Runners should also evolve to compete for survival against the Bombs.

## Levels
Higher levels should prove more difficult for the player to destroy all Runners with Bombs.
This may be achieved by faster Runner movement or possibly faster evolution of the Runners.
